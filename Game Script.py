Welcome! 

In a land where baking is a skill revered among gods and men alike,
one humble young baker strives to conquer all by defeating the tyrannical queen
of baking herself, Mary Berry, and delivering fortune and glory to House Starch.
For too long has this evil overlord of the croissant reigned down on all other
noble patissiers. Cursed by an evil spell placed on them, all baking endeavours
attempted by anyone other than Mary Berry will burn, fall flat or just fail
miserably. It is time that they rise up and break the dark mistress’s monopoly
on all things baked by stealing the secret recipe for the source of her power,
The Scone of Enchantment. This perilous quest is a task left to you, master baker.
Good luck! 

Starting room –  

You have infiltrated the lair of the queen, but be careful not to wake the beast.
The journey here so far has been a long and challenging one, but things are
about to get harder. You find yourself standing in a vast, expansive room in
the centre of the Red Velvet Keep, the palace from which Mary Berry pulls the
strings over the Seven Kingdoms. The room is airily chilling.
The air is filled with flour dust, illuminated by strands of light beaming in
from the windows. The walls are adorned with paintings of baked goods and in
the centre is a stone statue of a croquembouche.  On the far wall is a large,
arched doorway with two key holes. One appears to be made from ginger bread,
the other from shortbread. On one side is a door labelled Pantry. Whilst, on the 
other side is a door labelled Cellar, and a stairway leading down.  

Pantry 

You are in the pantry. Surrounding you from all directions are shelves towering
all the way to the ceiling, stacked full of pastries, cakes, loafs of bread and
a plethora of cooking ingredients. You notice a chest with the lid slightly
ajar. On the far wall is a large freezer door.  In the centre of the room
(insert puzzle).  

(Chest – Open chest – In the chest you find a large wooden rolling pin.
The rolling pin looks quite heavy and would certainly do a lot of damage if
bludgeoned relentlessly against someone’s skull.) 

Walk in freezer 

You enter the walk in freezer. Immediately you are chilled to your core, but not
because of the temperature, but instead because of what stands in front of you.
A zombie like Paul Hollywood stands with his arms crossed, staring coldly at you.
His eyes black and cavernous. His heart has been turned to ice Mary Berry and now
his only sanctuary is in the confines of the  walk in freezer. You notice in his
back pocket that there's a key made from ginger bread.  

(Battle Paul Hollywood – use rolling pin – take key) 

Cellar 

You descend into the under belly of Mary’s fortress of pain. The cellar is dark
and damp, the only light coming from a few flickering candles hung on the walls.
Empty crates and wooden pallets scatter the room. You notice on the floor an
elaborate rug, an heirloom of the Berry family no doubt. One of the corners is
upturned slightly. On the far wall is a door labelled store room.  In the centre
of the room is (insert puzzle).  

(Move rug – There is a trap door underneath – open trap door – you have
discovered a cubby hole. In it you find (insert weapon) (a bag of salt,
sure to inflict a lot of pain were it accidentally thrown into the eyes of an
unsuspecting by stander). 

Store room 

You enter the store room. As you walk down a narrow hallway you notice that it 
becomes continually larger with each step you take. You can hear a mumbling of 
voices which get louder and clearer as you approach the room. There you find Mel 
and Sue cracking jokes full of innuendo, some so bad that it pains your ears. It 
takes them a moment to notice you but they then fall silent as they turn to face 
you, their eyes piercing like daggers in your chest. You notice a key made of 
short bread in Mel’s jacket pocket. 

(Fight Mel and Sue – take key – return to main room) 

You carefully slot the keys into their respective key holes and turn them
simultaneously. You hear a bolt crank back and the creaking door slides open,
revealing what appears to be a maze. (insert maze description) 

Main baking you 

You have made it this far but you must now rely on your baking ability more
than ever. This is it. The final showdown. The stage is set, the show must now
unfold. And the far end of the room is a great fiery furnace, the heat from
which is scolding even from this distance. You have well and truly descended
into Mary’s hell. In front of the furnace you see four ingredients laid out on a
table; mill, flour, butter and eggs. But there in front of you is a sight that
fills you with dread, 5 feet and 3 inches of the pastry queen herself. She stairs
you dead in the eye, points are you with her bony finger and an evil, wry smile
spreads across her face. (fight Mary Berry)  

Ding dong old chap, the wicked witch is dead! You pry a piece of crumpled
parchment from her cold, dead hands which reveals to you the secret recipe of
Mary’s magical scones. (Flour, butter, milk, eggs). All you have to do now is
bake the perfect scone and the curse that has plagued this land will be forever
broken.  

(Scone baked in right order – bakes perfect scone – and there it is, a delicious,
light, fluffy scone. Bards will marvel over your greatness for years to come and
House Starch will be immortalised forever in song. Well done!) 

Scone baked in wrong order or Mary defeats you -  oh dear, it appears you have
come all this way just to become unstuck by a soggy bottom. You have brought
shame upon House Starch!)
